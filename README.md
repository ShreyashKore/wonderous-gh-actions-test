Wonderous Compose is a port of Wonderous
in [Compose Multiplatform.](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/)
Wonderous Compose is a visual showcase of eight wonders of the world.
The [original project](https://flutter.gskinner.com/wonderous/) was built
by team [gskinner](https://gskinner.com/flutter/)
using [Flutter.](https://flutter.dev/) This project is a tribute to their original
work, with an aim to explore the design possibilities with Compose.

## Outline

* For navigation, the [PreCompose](https://github.com/Tlaster/PreCompose/) library is used. This has
  a similar API to the AndroidX navigation
  library.
* [Home Screen](composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/ui/screens/home/HomeScreen.kt) shows the usage of
  HorizontalPager along with AnimatedVisibility for animating
  foreground and background elements.
* [ArtifactList Screen](composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/ui/screens/ArtifactListScreen.kt)
  uses [`ArtifactListViewModel`](composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/ui/screens/ArtifactListViewModel.kt)
  view model for business logic.
* [ArtifactDetails Screen](composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/ui/screens/ArtifactDetailsScreen.kt)
  demonstrates writing business logic in the UI layer itself.
* [Editorial Screen](composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/ui/screens/EditorialScreen.kt) uses LazyColumn
  layout and its scroll APIs to
  drive animations/transitions for elements
  when they appear on the screen.
* Map View demonstrates how KMP and Compose's interoperability layer can be used to embed native UIs
  in Compose.
    * For Android Google Map compose library is used.
    * For IOS MKMapView is used.
    * For web [Wasm Html interop](https://github.com/Hamamas/Kotlin-Wasm-Html-Interop) library is
      used to draw DOM elements on canvas. This allows us to
      use [leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) and an iframe(for the satellite view) to show the
      map.
    * For desktop; mapview-desktop module is
      copied from the official
      [compose samples](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform/tree/master/examples/imageviewer/mapview-desktop).
      This sample uses OpenStreetMap data to draw map tiles on Compose Canvas.
* The [Photo Gallery screen](composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/ui/screens/PhotoGalleryScreen.kt)
  makes use of a custom layout and also uses a custom gesture detection
  modifier.
* [Timeline screen](composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/ui/screens/timeline/TimelineScreen.kt)
  uses [`TimelineState`](composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/ui/screens/timeline/TimelineScreen.kt)
  which
  is kind of a view controller for managing state of timeline. It manages conversion
  of year to scroll position and vice versa.

## Libraries Used

- [Ktor](https://ktor.io/): HTTP networking
- [PreCompose](https://github.com/Tlaster/PreCompose): Navigation
- [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil): Image Loading
- [compose-webview-multiplatform](https://github.com/KevinnZou/compose-webview-multiplatform):
  WebView for Android, IOS
  and Desktop
- [maps-compose](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/maps-compose): Maps on
  Android

## Source Sets

This project uses experimental DSL to configure custom hierarchy.

```kotlin
applyDefaultHierarchyTemplate {
    common {
        group("nonWeb") {
            withAndroidTarget()
            withNative()
            withJvm()
        }
        group("web") {
            withJs()
            withWasm()
        }
    }
}
```

Here 2 additional intermediate source sets are created to share code among web platforms.

- `nonWeb` contains all the targets except JS and WASM.
- `web` contains only the JS and WASM targets

## TODO

* ~~WASM support~~
* Collectibles and My Collection Screen
* Localization
* Gesture support on Web and Desktop platforms
* Shared Element Transition on the home screen
* ~~Haptics~~

## Set up the environment

> For compose multiplatform setup information
> checkout its [template repo](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform-template).

- Add Google Maps key in `local.properties` at the project root.

```properties
MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
```
