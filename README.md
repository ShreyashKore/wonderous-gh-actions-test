# Wonderous Compose

> ðŸš§ WORK IN PROGRESS ðŸš§

Wonderous Compose is a port of Wonderous
in [Compose Multiplatform.](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/)
Wonderous Compose is a visual showcase of eight wonders of the world.
The [original project](https://flutter.gskinner.com/wonderous/) was built
by team [gskinner](https://gskinner.com/flutter/)
using [Flutter.](https://flutter.dev/) This project is a tribute to their original
work, with an aim to explore the design possibilities with Compose.

## Outline

* For navigation, PreCompose library is used. This has similar API to the AndroidX navigation
  library.
* HomeScreen shows the usage of HorizontalPager along with AnimatedVisibility for animating
  foreground and background elements
* ArtifactListScreen uses a ViewModel to store business logic.
* ArtifactDetailsScreen demonstrates writing business logic in the UI layer itself.
* Editorial Screen uses LazyColumn layout and usage of scroll APIs to drive animations for elements
  when they appear on the screen.
* Map View demonstrates how KMP and Compose's interoperability layer can be used to embed native UIs
  in Compose.
* Photo Gallery screen makes use of a custom layout and also uses a custom gesture detection
  modifier.

## Work In Progress

* Web support
* Collectibles and My Collection Screen
* Localization
* Shared Element Transition on home screen
* Haptics
